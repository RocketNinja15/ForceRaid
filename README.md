# ForceRaid
Fuck with your neighbor's minecraft server
# Installation
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Do `npm i -g forceraid` in your terminal. After that run `fraid`, it will host a HTTP server locally for the [Force Raid GUI](https://fraid.vercel.app/) to work, now open your browser and head over to [Force Raid GUI](https://fraid.vercel.app/. Now the GUI will ask you for the Minecraft server details, put it in and click on `Raid` button, the application will start attacking the server.
